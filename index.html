  <!-- //As a developer, I want to use thoughtful and descriptive console.log() throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging. -->
   <!-- As a developer, I want to convert some of my appropriate biographical elements into unordered lists, such as my education summary and/or my work experience.
   As a developer, I want to consider the user experience (UX) of my About Me and guessing game, trying to view it through the eyes of a user. Wait... maybe I should just write a user story for that...
   As an end user of the About Me and guessing game, I want to have an informative, interesting, and fun experience in learning about the developer.
   As a prospective job seeker, I want to consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception.
   As a prospective job seeker, I want to make myself more personable by adding a Top Ten list to the bottom of my About Me page with an ordered list in HTML, for instance, my Top Ten Favorite Movies or my Top Ten Places I Want to Visit, or something along those lines.
   As a prospective job seeker, I was to use CSS to creatively and tastefully style and layout my page. -->
